-- Using CTE (Common Table Expression) to make a sub-query like query and write a query that pull information from it
WITH CTE_Employee as 
(Select FirstName, LastName, Gender, Salary,
COUNT(Gender) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) as TotalGender,
AVG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) as AvgSalary
FROM SQLTutorial..EmployeeDemographics emp
JOIN SQLTuturial..EmployeeSalary sal
  ON emp.EmployeeID = sal.EmployeeID
WHERE Salary > '45000'
)
Select FirstName, Salary
From CTE_Employee

--What did I find? (This is my current understanding. Hopefully in time I will grasp the correct use if not here)
-- First I used a CTE to essential make a sub query. I wanted look for employees with a salary of $45,000, take the FirstName, LastName, Gender, and Salary. Then count and distinguish all of the genders, then find the average salary of the genders. Last, I wanted to get the FirstNames and Salary from the results of the CTE.
-- The CTE is not stored anywhere, unlike a sub query
